 # Movie-Perspectives

Movie Perspectives is a full‑stack passion project built with a React + TypeScript front end and a .NET 8.0 backend with a SQL database. Born out of my love of movies and storytelling - and as a hands‑on project for NZMSA 2025 Phase 2 — this webapp lets users browse films, share reviews, chat about their favorite scenes, and exchange unique perspectives.

Demo: Please watch the walkthrough video here.
